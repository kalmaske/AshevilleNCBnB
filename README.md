# AshevilleNCBnB

Overall Application Concept ..

      The application built allows a user to  host a place to stay by entering information about the house they want to post .

      The host can be a member who can can add a place to stay with details of the place provided such as room type, price, and nights available for clients to book. 

      Our motivation was wanting to enjoy a nice few days vacation and be able to search for places to stay in one city without worrying that itâ€™s far from where you plan to go.
